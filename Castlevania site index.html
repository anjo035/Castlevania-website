            The Castlevania Timeline shows the official chronology of the Castlevania series. It was first revealed in Konami Magazine in <em>1997.</em> 
            The timeline was intended to be a reference for the developers of Symphony of the Night, and at the time, was not intented to be officially published, as the team felt it would force them to drag on the series. 
            It was based on an earlier timeline created during the development of Castlevania: Bloodlines by the game's director, Toshiki Yamamura
